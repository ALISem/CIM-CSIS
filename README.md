In this  work, we've developed an eclipse-based graphical editor to support modeling of context information for intelligent context-sensitive systems (CSS). Particularly, it is designed to assist context identification and management (CIM).

***The resulting graphical support tool from Ali Baddourâ€™s PhD Dissertation at Chongqing University - School of Big Data and Software Engineering "Model-Based Context Identification and Management Methodology for Intelligent Systems Analysis and Design (CIM-CSS)" (Supervised by Prof. Jun Sang).***
